                <b>Abstract</b>
The present article is devoted to well-posedness by noise for the continuity equation.
Namely, we consider the continuity equation with non-linear and partially degenerate stochas-
tic perturbations in divergence form. We prove the existence and uniqueness of entropy so-
lutions under hypotheses on the velocity field which are weaker than those required in the
deterministic setting. This extends related results of Flandoli/Gubinelli/Priola [7] applicable
to linear multiplicative noise to a non-linear setting. The existence proof relies on a duality
argument which makes use of the regularity theory for fully non-linear parabolic equations.
